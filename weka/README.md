# Weka 

This section covers an introduction to using [Weka](http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/index.html) from the commandline. The Weka GUI is convenient, but many times it is easier to work in the shell than with a GUI. You will need to obtain the Weka jar file, which can be downloaded [here](http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/downloading.html). The scripts provided in this section was built on a Mac; however, they should run on Linux as well. You will need to do some extra work if you want execute these commands in a Windows environment.

# Before getting started

Download the executable [Weka jar file](http://www.cs.waikato.ac.nz/ml/weka/downloading.html) and place it into the `weka/` path of this repository. The code in this repo was tested with Weka 3.

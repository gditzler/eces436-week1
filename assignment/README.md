# Lab Assignment 

The data sets are saved in `arff` files and can be found in the `assignment/data/` directory. Complete the items below for the week 1  lab assignment. Note, that you do not need to use Weka at the command line for this assignment. Using the GUI will be sufficient.

## Pattern Recognition in Weka

* Evaluate a naive Bayes classifier on the `diabetes.arff` data set using 15-fold cross validation. Set the option to use a kernel density estmator (see the `useKernelEstimator` option). Report the classification error and the ROC curve for the `tested_positive` class. What is the auROC?
* Evaluate AdaBoost.M1 on the same data set. Use `J48` as the base classifier and run AdaBoost for 50 iterations using resampling. Report the classification error and the ROC curve for the `tested_positive` class. What is the auROC?
* Repeat for the `diabetes.arff` data set. However, rather than using a naive Bayes in Part 1, choose a different classifier. 
* Hint: Perform the same comparision using Weka's experimentor.  

## Classification Tools in Matlab

* Run 5-fold cross validation on Fisher's Iris and the ionoshpere data set. These data sets are included with Matlab installation. 
* Helpful functions: `NaiveBayes.fit`, `cvpartition`, `predict`, `load`.
* Starter Code: 
```matlab 
  % clean up the work space
  clc;
  clear; 
  close all;

  % load the data; X -> data; Y -> labels
  load ionoshpere;
  [n_samples,n_features] = size(X);

  % call cvpartion here
  
  % run CV
  error = zeros(1,5);
  for k = 1:5
    % use the cv partition object to split the training/testing data

    % train the naive bayes classifier

    % test the naive bayes classifier

    % measure the error (% of incorrect predictions on the test data)
    
    % compute the area under the ROC curve
  end
  disp(mean(error));

  % plot the ROC curve from the last fold (do not average ROC curves)
```
